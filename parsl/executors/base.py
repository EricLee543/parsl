        We haven't yet decided on what the args to this can be,
        whether it should just be func, args, kwargs or be the partially evaluated
        fn

        BENC: based on how ipp uses this, this follows the semantics of async_apply from ipyparallel.
        Based on how the thread executor works, its:

            https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html
            Schedules the callable, fn, to be executed as fn(*args **kwargs) and returns a Future object representing the execution of the callable.

        These are consistent

        The value returned must be some kind of future that I'm a bit vague on the
        strict requirements for:

             it must be possible to assign a retries_left member slot to that object.
             it's referred to as exec_fu - but it's whatever the underlying executor returns (ipp, thread pools, whatever) which has some Future-like behaviour
                  - so is it always the case that we can add retries_left? (I guess the python model permits that but it's a bit type-ugly)
